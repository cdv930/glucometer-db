Every stripe tube has its own code that you had to put when turning it on. You put blood on the stripe, and press the button. A countdown from 60 seconds begins. At around 22-21 a beep starts. You had to wipe off the blood, and put the stripe inside the thing that is at the bottom that opens and closes. When the countdown ended, you had your value.
